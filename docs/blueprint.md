## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark Blue (#1E3A8A) provides a professional and technological feel, aligning with the academy's core concept.
- Background color: Very dark desaturated blue (#0A0F1A). Using a background of the same hue creates harmony while preserving the professional feel. Its darkness provides maximum contrast with most other colors.

- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, readable UI. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use icons related to technology and learning for each module to enhance visual appeal.
- Incorporate smooth gradients and backdrop blur effects to create a visually engaging and modern interface, inspired by Discord.
- Apply smooth page transitions to enhance user experience. Keep animations subtle to maintain professionalism.
